## Give your computer eyes to see the World!

CortexCV is an AI-powered python library designed to abstract away the complexities of implementing computer vision and testing your trained models to simulate real time inference prediction to new, unseen data from camera live feed.

## How to install?

In your project root directory, run this on your CMD or terminal. The library is available in my github for now..

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/KarkAngelo114/CortexCV.git
```

## Pre-requisites
- must have at least Python 3.8.10 installed
- must have installed these libraries
    - opencv-python
    - tensorflow
    - keras
    - psutil
    - onnxruntime
    - numpy
    - pillow

pip installation command for the libraries that CortexCV depends on:

```bash
pip install opencv-python tensorflow keras psutil onnxruntime numpy pillow
```

## Notes:
while you can load multiple models at once, ensure that your machine has enough resources for intensive computations.
